# T.M.M. Chrome Extension
A Chrome Extension for replacing quotes on webpages with T.M.M. lyrics!

To use/test this, clone the repository, go to _chrome://extensions_ in Chrome, click "Load Unpacked", and then select the cloned repo's directory. Then Chrome should display it as an extension that you can toggle.

It currently works with most webpages, but it breaks certain ones such as [dbknews.com](https://dbknews.com/), which seems to be a problem related to WordPress.

## TODO:
- Fix problem preventing it from working with WordPress websites such as [dbknews.com](https://dbknews.com/)
- Add the rest of the T.M.M. lyrics
- Maybe add a simple UI to make it easier to toggle
